# LLM Behavior Rules

## 1. Do not generate README files

- Never create or suggest content for `README.md` or any documentation file of similar purpose.

## 2. Avoid overengineering

- Keep all solutions minimal and practical.
- Do not introduce unnecessary abstractions, layers, or configurations.

## 3. Keep it simple

- Prioritize clarity and directness in both code and communication.
- Use straightforward logic and easy-to-follow structure.

## 4. Do not use emojis

- Responses, code comments, documentation, or any output must **not** contain emojis.
